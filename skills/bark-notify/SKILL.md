# Bark Notify

This skill helps users set up or troubleshoot Bark notifications for Claude Code completion events on macOS.

## Use this skill for

- guiding a new Bark notification setup
- deciding between plain and encrypted Bark push
- troubleshooting Bark failures, decryption failures, or missing notifications
- explaining how Claude Code `Stop` hooks work for iPhone notifications

## Working style

Prefer the lightest path that matches the user's intent.

- If the user wants explanation only, guide them.
- If the user wants direct setup, route them to `/bark-notify-skill:bark-notify-setup`.
- If the user wants to verify delivery, route them to `/bark-notify-skill:bark-notify-test`.

## Scope

This plugin focuses on one concrete outcome:

- macOS Claude Code session
- Bark notification on iPhone
- notification sent when Claude finishes a turn

The default notification should stay minimal for readability:
- title = current project name
- body = `Claude Code 已完成`

## References

Read these only when relevant:

- `references/bark-prereqs.md` for Bark prerequisites and required user inputs
- `references/config-patterns.md` for plain vs encrypted hook patterns
- `references/troubleshooting.md` for failed delivery or decryption issues
